                     |
                     | The package contains a data structure for the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed input as well
                     | as the parser for the different language of the TPTP, see http://tptp.org for details. In particular,
                     | parser are available for:
                     |   - THF (TH0/TH1): Monomorphic and polymorphic higher-order logic,
                     |   - TFF (TF0/TF1): Monomorphic and polymorphic typed first-order logic,
                     |   - FOF: Untyped first-order logic,
                     |   - TCF: Typed clause-normal form,
                     |   - CNF: (Untyped) clause-normal form, and
                     |   - TPI: TPTP Process Instruction language.
                     |
                     | Currently, parsing of TFX (FOOL) is not supported. Apart from that, the parser
                     | should cover every other language dialect.
                     | The parser is based on v7.4.0.3 of the TPTP syntax BNF (http://tptp.org/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html).""".stripMargin,
